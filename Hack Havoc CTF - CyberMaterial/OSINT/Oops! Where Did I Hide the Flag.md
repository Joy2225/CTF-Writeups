Oops! In the midst of creating this OSINT challenge, I might’ve forgotten where I hid the flag in a video post. I remember it was about some interesting news, alerts, and incidents—so many things. Who knew social media could be so… forgettable? 😅

Put on your detective hat, dive into the social media jungle, and show me you can find what even I forgot! 🕵️‍♂️💡
## Solution

Based on the description, the flag is somewhere in a video post which will have topics like ` interesting news, alerts, and incidents`. Well thats the cyber breifing posts. Went to youtube channel of Cybermaterial only to find out many such videos. Started to see and read the description of every video starting from the latest. 

Finally found the flag in the description of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4vtqkhmIo
