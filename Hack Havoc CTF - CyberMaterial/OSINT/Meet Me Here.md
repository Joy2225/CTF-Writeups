## Solution

This the challenge that I spent a lot of unnecessary time on. The solution was really simple tho.

First I went to the socials of `Cover6 Solutions` to find info about the person in the picture.
On insta I found his name. `Tyrone E. Wilson` the CEO. From there I searched him on LinkedIn, and found that he stays in `Virginia`.

Next step I spent the most time on. On google road view I tried to find the place in virginia that had both `waffle inn and subway`.  After frying my braincells altogether, I searched `"Waffle inn" Virginia` and this gave me the answer. It was just that simple.
