## Solution
On going to the website we see stiff written in various languages as said that the website was drunk.

I checked the source code to find another href `http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/homepage.html#`. 

Also there were fake flags on both of the previous pages.

Here also it was kindoff similar. Again checking the source code I saw an invisible button code, which takes to the link `http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/0.html`.


On checking its source code, we find the flag.
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hidden Message</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: white; /* Set background color to white */
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
        .hidden-text {
            position: absolute; /* Remove from the normal document flow */
            width: 1px; /* Minimize the width */
            height: 1px; /* Minimize the height */
            margin: -1px; /* Move out of view */
            padding: 0; /* Remove padding */
            overflow: hidden; /* Hide any overflow */
            clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0); /* Clip the text */
            border: 0; /* Remove any border */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="hidden-text">
        Well, I guess I'll be fired in the morning for making such an amazing website. 
        But you can get this flag.
        CM{W3bs1t3_15_5hi7}
