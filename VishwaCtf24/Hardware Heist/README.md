# <u>Hardware Heist</u>

* **Tool Used:** [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code)

## Description
Your cyber gang has stolen a hardware device code from the CIA but are unable to use it. Although while stealing the code, you have found some binary strings which might be helpful to understand the device. You might even find the important codes after solving the device and strings.

## Solution
After downloading the attachments and checking the content of the binary txt file, I simply tried to put it in the online binary to ascii tool mentioned above. Luckily I got the flag directly. So I didn't have to use the other file.
